The wild Rover
V

I've been a wild rover for many's the year
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more

I went to an alehouse I used to frequent
I told the landlady my money was spent
I ask her for credit, she answered me nay
Such a custom as yours I can have any day

And it's no, nay, never ...

I brought from me pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said:'I have whiskeys and wines of the best
And the words that you told me were only in jest'

And it's no, nay, never ...

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they've caressed me, as oft times before
I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never ...
