Ouga Chaka ouga! ....

I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me.
Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me.
When you hold me in your arms so tight,
You let me know, Everythings alright, ahahah

I'm hooked on a feeling,
I'm high on believing,
That you’re in love with me.

Lips as sweet as candy, their taste stays on my mind.
Girl, you keep me thirsty for another cup of wine.

I got it bad for you girl, but I don't need a cure,
I'll just stay addicted, If I can endure
All the good love, when we're all alone
Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on.

I'mmm, I'mmm hooked on a feeling.
I'm high on believing that your in love with me.
All the good love, when we're all alone
Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on.

Ahahaa 
I'm hooked on a feeling,
I'm high on believing,
That you’re in love with me.
