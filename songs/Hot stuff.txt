Hot stuff
P

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some lovin' tonight
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need some hot stuff

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Want to share my love with a warm blooded lover
Want to bring a wild man back home
Lookin' for some hot stuff
Sittin' here eatin' my heart out, no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers lately
I'm bound to find somebody home
Lookin' for some hot stuff
