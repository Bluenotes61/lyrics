The boxer
P

I'm just a poor boy
though my story’s seldom told
I have squandered my resistance 
for a pocketful of mumbles Such are promises:
All lies and jests still a
man hears what he wants to hear
and disregards the rest

Hmmmm

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station Runnin’ scared
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters, 
where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know.

Lie la lie

Asking only workman’s wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare  there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there oh la la
la la la la

Now the years are rolling by me
they are rockin’ evenly
I am older than I once was
and younger than I'll be that's not unusual
No it isn't strange after changes upon changes
we are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

Lie la lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
and wishing I was gone goin’ home
Where the new york city
winters aren’t bleedin’ me
Leading me to going home

In the clearing stands a boxer, 
and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the
reminders of every glove
that laid him down or cut him 
’til he cried out 
in his anger and his shame:
I am leaving, I am leaving!
but the fighter still remains

Lie la lie...
