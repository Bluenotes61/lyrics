Night fever
P
Bee gees

Listen to the ground: there is movement all around.
There is somethin’ goin' down, and I can feel it.
On the waves of the air, there is dancin' out there.
If it's somethin' we can share, we can steal it.

That sweet city woman, she moves through the light,
Controlling my mind and my soul.
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right, 

The night fever, night fever: we know how to do it.
Gimme the night fever, night fever: we know how to show it.
Here I am, prayin' for this moment to last,
Livin' on the music so fine, borne on the wind, makin' it mine.
The night fever, night fever: we know how to do it.
Gimme the night fever, night fever: we know how to show it.

In the heat of our love, don't need no help for us to make it.
Gimme just enough takin’ us to the mornin'.
I got fire in my mind. I get higher in my walkin', 
And I'm glowin' in the dark; I give you warnin'.

That sweet city woman, she moves through the light,
Controlling my mind and my soul.
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right, 

The night fever, night fever: we know how to do it.
Gimme the night fever, night fever: we know how to show it.
Here I am, prayin' for this moment to last,
Livin' on the music so fine, borne on the wind, makin' it mine.
Night fever, night fever: we know how to do it.
Gimme the night fever, night fever: we know how to show it.
Gimme the night fever, night fever: we know how to do it.
Gimme the night fever, night fever: we know how to show it.
Gimme the night fever, night fever: we know how to do it.
