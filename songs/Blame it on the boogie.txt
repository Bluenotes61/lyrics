Blame it on the boogie

My baby's always dancin'
And wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin'
And that's no lie

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't, on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
