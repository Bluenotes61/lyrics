Just a gigolo
P


Just a gigolo 
everywhere I go 
people know the part 
I'm playing 
Paid for every dance 
selling each romance 
every night some heart 
betraying 

There will come a day 
youth will pass away 
then what will they say 
about me 
When the end comes I know 
they'll say just a gigolo 
as life goes on without me 
Just a gigolo...

'Cause I aint got nobody 
nobody cares for me nobody nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely 
sad and lonely sad and lonely 
Won't some sweet mama 
come and take a chance with me 
cause I aint so bad 
Get along with me babe, 
been singin love songs 
All of the time 
Even only be, honey only, only be 
Bop bozdee bozdee bop zitty bop 

I ain't got nobody nobody cares for me nobody
Hummala bebhuhla zeebuhla boobuhla 
hummala bebhuhla zeebuhla bop 

I ain't got nobody, 
nobody nobody cares for me, nobody, nobody 
I'm so sad and lonely, 
sad and lonely, sad and lonely, 
Won't some sweet mama come 
and take a chance with me 
cause I aint so bad 

Get along with me babe, 
been singin love songs 
All of the time 
Even only be, honey only, only be 
osv... nobody cares for me.
