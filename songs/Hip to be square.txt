Hip to be square
P
Huey Lewis

I used to be a renegade, I used to fool around 
But I couldn't take the punishment, and had to settle down 
Now I'm playing it real straight, and yes I cut my hair 
You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care 
Because I can tell what's going on 

It's hip to be a square
It's hip to be a square

I like my bands in business suits, I watch them on TV 
I'm working out most everyday and watching what I eat 
They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even care 
I know that it's crazy 
I know that it's nowhere 
But there is no denying that 

It's hip to be a square
It's hip to be a square
So hip to be a square 

It's not too hard to figure out, you see it everyday 
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way 
You see them on the freeway, It don't look like a lot of fun 
But don't you try to fight it; "An idea who's time has come."

Don't tell me that I'm crazy 
Don’t tell me I'm nowhere 
Take it from me 

It's hip to be a square
It's hip to be a square
It's hip to be a square
So hip to be a square

Here, There, and everywhere!
Hip, Hip, so hip to be a square!
Here, There, and everywhere!
Hip, Hip,
