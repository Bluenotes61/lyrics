The ravaging song

My mare is getting wild and neighing louder and higher,
longing for my bum. She really loves me - and I her.
Soon we're gonna' rumble like the fire on the steppe.
So take me to the stables! I myself will untie her.
How I long to jog along with you and perspire!
Lift me in the saddle, buddies, 
I'll be galopping with pep!

For now is the time for bruising,
raping the women, using
bad and bawdy language, 
kicking kids and rolling in the mud!
Yes, now is the time for boozing,
fibbing the lot, abusing
everyone and everything
and painting Samarkand with blood!

I'll play with Swedish matches and set Asia on fire.
A flaming conflagration is a thing i admire!
For an ardent arse an arson is a kind of kick!
I'll scorch the Queen of Samarkand, but first I will try her -
that will be the furnace for my burning desire.
She has many maids-in-waiting,
so I'd better make it quick!

For now is the time for bruising...
