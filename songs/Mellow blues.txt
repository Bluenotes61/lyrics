When you wake up in the morning, and you’re in that mellow kind of mood
I said, when you wake up in the morning, and you’re in that mellow kind of mood
You will need the kind of music that will ease your solitude

You are craving for some blues, that can cause your tears to fall
Some blues and sweet soul music to fill your spirit overall
The way to find that mellow music is in the mellofestival

Nothing else can touch your heart
Make your spirit wanna cry
like the music in the mello
it can make you wanna die
Watch the tv, make your vote
I know if you only could
you would vote for every song
‘cause they’re all so good

So c’mon and sing this mellofestival blues
with the soulful mello music
you can never ever lose
