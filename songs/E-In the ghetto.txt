In the ghetto *
A

As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
Ella Ehlde

And her mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
Ella Ehlde

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or she'll grow to be an angry young girl some day
Take a look at you and me,
Are we too blind to see,
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little girl with a runny nose
She plays in the street as the cold wind blows
Ella Ehlde

And her hunger burns
So she starts to roam the streets each day
And she learns how to dance
And she learns how to play
Ella Ehlde

Then one night in desperation
the young girl breaks away
She buys a horn and she starts to play
And she tries to sing, horn is in the way
And her mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round a playing young girl
She's singing and playing and starting to swirl
Ella Ehlde

As the young girl smiles,
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
Ella Ehlde
And her mama cries
