Killing me softly
P
Roberta Flack

Strumming my pain with his fingers 
Singing my life with his words 
Killing me softly with his song 
Killing me softly with his song 
Telling my whole life with his words 
Killing me softly with his song 

I heard he sang a good song, 
I heard he had a style, 
And so I came to see him
and listen for a while 
And there he was this young boy 
Stranger to my eyes 

Strumming my pain with his fingersâ€¦

I felt all flushed with fever 
Embarrased by the crowd, 
I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud, 
I pray that he would finish 
But he just kept right on 

Strumming my pain with his fingers
