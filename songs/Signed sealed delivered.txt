Signed, sealed, delivered, Iâ€™m yours
P
Stevie Wonder

Like a fool I went and stayed too long 
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong 
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, 
I'm yours 

Then that time I went and said goodbye 
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry 
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, 
I'm yours 

Here I am baby 
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby, 
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours

Seen a lot of things in this old world 
When I touched them they did nothing, girl 
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, 
I'm yours, oh I'm yours 

Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire 
That's why I know you are my only desire 
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, 
I'm yours 

Here I am baby 
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby,
Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours
