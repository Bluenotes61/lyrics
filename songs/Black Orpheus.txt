Black Orpheus

I sing to the sun in the sky
I'll sing till the sun rises high
Carnival time is here
magical time of year
and as the time draws near
dreams lift my heart

I'll sing while I play my guitar
I'll cling to this dream from afar
will true love come my way
on this magical day
and will love stay in my heart

coda:
Will true love come my way
on this magical day
or will love only live in my dreams?
