Kiss
P

You don't have to be beautiful 
to turn me on
I just need your body baby 
from dusk till dawn
You don't need experience 
to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your
kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby
if you wanna impress me
You can't be to flirty, mama
I know how to undress me 
I want to be your fantasy
Maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your
kiss

Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama 
Not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty 
To have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me
My love will be your food 
Yeah

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your
kiss
