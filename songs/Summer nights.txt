D: Summer lovin' had me a blast
S: Summer lovin' happened so fast
D: I met a girl crazy for me
S: Met a boy cute as can be
D+S: Summer days driftin' away, to uh-oh those summer nights

Alla: Uh Well-a well-a well-a huh
Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far? 
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car?
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh

D: She swam by me, she got a cramp
S: He ran by me, got my suit damp
D: I saved her life, she nearly drowned
S: He showed off, splashing around
D+S: Summer sun, something's begun, but uh-oh those summer nights

Alla: Uh well-a well-a well-a huh
Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?
Uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh

D: Took her bowling in the arcade
S: We went strolling, drank lemonade
D: We made out under the dock
S: We stayed out 'till ten o'clock
D+S: Summer fling, don't mean a thing, but uh-oh those summer nights

Alla: Uh well-a well-a well-a huh
Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
Cos he sounds like a drag
shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop,shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, YEH

S: He got friendly, holding my hand
D: While she got friendly down in the sand
S: He was sweet, just turned eighteen
D: Well she was good you know what I mean
Alla: Woah!
D+S: Summer heat, boy and girl meet, but uh-oh those summer nights

Alla: woo, woo, woo
Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

S: It turned colder - that's where it ends
D: So I told her we'd still be friends
S: Then we made our true love vow
S: Wonder what she's doing now
D+S: Summer dreams ripped at the seams,
bu-ut oh, those su-ummer nights....

Alla:Tell me more, tell me more!
