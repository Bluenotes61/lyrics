On the sunny side of the street

Grab your coat
Grab your hat, baby
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
On the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear a pitter-pat, babe?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
My Rover's crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rock-e-fellow
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
