Lay back and be cool
P

She had "love" tattooed on her back
Had a mean ol' two-tone Pontiac
She could put you off with her attitude
She said, "I just want to lay back and be cool"

She's on a punk shock, hot rod, Hollywood crusing trip
She found me crying in a parking lot on Sunset Strip
She said, "Come on baby, I'll be good to you
I just want to lay back and be cool"

Been a long time
Still think of her at night
We were drifters
Just looking for the light

(She took me up)
She took me up somewhere in the hills
(The hills)
Turned me 'round, cured me of my ills
(My ills)
I stayed a year with her, well, maybe more like two
I just got to lay back and be cool

I need bread, I don't got none at all
I been thinking about going down south this fall
I want to make easy money, and get by when I'm blue
I just want to lay back and be cool

I want to make easy money, and get by when I'm blue
I just want to lay back and be cool
I want to make easy money, and get by when I'm blue
I just want to lay back and be cool
And be cool
And be cool
And be cool.
