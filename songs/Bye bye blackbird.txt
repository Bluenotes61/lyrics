Bye bye blackbird

Pack up all my care and woe
here I go singin' low
Bye bye blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
sugar's sweet , so is he
Bye bye blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me

Make my bed and light the light
I'll be home late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye
