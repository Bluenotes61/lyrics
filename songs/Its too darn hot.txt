It's too darn hot

It's too darn hot!
It's too darn hot!
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight,
And fill the cup with my baby tonight.
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight,
Refill the cup with my baby tonight,
But I ain't up to my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot

It's too darn hot!
It's too darn hot!
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight,
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight.
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight,
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight.
But I wont fight with my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot

According to the Kinsey Report
Ev'ry average man you know
Likes his love-y dove-y to court
When the temperature is low,
But when the thermometer goes right up
And the weather is sizzling hot,
Mister Man with the plan is not

'Cause it's too darn hot!
It's too darn hot!
It's too darn hot!

It's too darn hot!
It's too darn hot!
I'd like to meet with my baby tonight
Get off my feet with my baby tonight
I'd like to meet with my baby tonight,
Get off my feet with my baby tonight
But no repeat with my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot!

According to the Kinsey Report
Ev'ry average man you know
Much prefers to play his favorite sport
When the temperature is low
But when the thermometer goes 'way up
And the weather is sizzling hot,
Mr. Adam for his madam is not,

'Cause it's too darn hot!
It's too darn hot!
It's too darn hot!
