Nine to five
P
Dolly Parton

Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen 
Pour myself a cup of ambition 
Yawnin', stretchin', try to come to life 
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin' 
Out on the streets the traffic starts jumpin' 
And folks like me on the job from nine to five 
Workin' nine to five 
What a way to make a livin' 
Barely gettin' by 
It's all takin' and no givin' 
They just use your mind 
And they never give you credit 
It's enough to drive you 
Crazy if you let it 
Nine to five, for service and devotion 
You would think that I 
Would deserve a fair promotion 
Want to move ahead 
But the boss won't seem to let me 
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me 
Mmmmm... 

They let your dream just a' watch 'em shatter 
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder 
But you got dreams he'll never take away 
In the same boat with a lot of your friends 
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in 
And the tide's gonna turn 
And it's all gonna roll your way 
Workin' nine to five 
What a way to make a livin' 
Barely gettin' by 
It's all takin' and no givin' 
They just use your mind 
And you never get the credit 
It's enough to drive you 
Crazy if you let it 
Nine to five, yeah 
They got you where they want you 
There's a better life 
And you think about it, don't you? 
It's a rich man's game 
No matter what they call it 
And you spend your life 
Puttin' money in his wallet 
Nine to five...
