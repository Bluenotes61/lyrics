Go over there, turn on the light
Hey, all the lights
Come over here, stand on that chair

Raise your arms up in the air

You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live

They don't believe in this love of mine
They don't know what love is

They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
Yeah, I know what love is

There ain't no way

Give me the reason to live
(You can leave your hat on)
You can leave your hat on
