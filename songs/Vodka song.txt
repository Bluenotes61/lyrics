Vodka song

Drink your vodka!
Drink your vodka!
All Mongolian kids
from a wad can
suck their vodka
None but God can
have more delicate drink!

Drink your vodka!
If I'm laughing
If I'm crying
If I'm dying
there is not a booze
that I rather use
except orange juice
that beats vodka!
Hep, hep!

And tonight
Halleluja!
we'll be tight
Halleluja
I insist:
Halleluja
Let's get pissed!
Halleluja
Dream our dreams away
Let tomorrow pay
for the present day
Drink your vodka!
Hep, hep!
