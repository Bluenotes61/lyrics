I know him so well
M

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long

Looking back I could have played it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well

Wasn't it good? / Oh so good
Wasn't he fine? / Oh so fine
Isn't it madness?
He can't be mine?
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
More security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide

Looking back I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then
Now at least I know him well

Wasn't it good? / Oh so good
Wasn't he fine? / Oh so fine
Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?
Didn't I know How it would go?
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart?

Wasn't it good?
Wasn't he fine
Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me -
More security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
It took time to understand him
I know him so well
