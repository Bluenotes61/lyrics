Boom boom
BS
John Lee Hooker

I love the way you walk
and I love the way you talk
When you walk that walk
and you talk that talk
I say hey, eh, hey man
I've got my eyes on you

Boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm gonna shoot you right down
boom, boom, boom, boom
'til you hit the ground
I say hey, eh, hey man
I'm in love with you
