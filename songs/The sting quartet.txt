The sting quartet

Darling, wake up!
You are the one and only
Now is the time,
come and make love with me!

Oh, is that you!
I feel so cold and lonely.
Please, do come in
for a nice cup of tea.

My clever plan 
as you can see is working.
And here he comes,
the other brother, lurking.

Good Lord: He took my Dame!
Why must he choose the same?
What do you think you're doing?
Dirty ass!
Soon you will bite in the grass!
