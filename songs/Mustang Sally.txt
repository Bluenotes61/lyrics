Guess you better slow that mustang down
Mustang Sally, now baby
Guess you better slow that mustang down
You've been running all over town

Oh, I guess you gotta put your flat feet on the ground

All you wanna do is ride around Sally 
All you wanna do is ride around Sally 
All you wanna do is ride around Sally

One of these early mornings
