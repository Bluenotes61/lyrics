Is you is or is you ain't my baby
J


I gotta a girl who's always late
Anytime we have a date
But I love her
Yes I love her

I'm gonna walk up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her

Is you is, or is you ain't, my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
You is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one you find
She's gone and made a change

Is you is, or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
