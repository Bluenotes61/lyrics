It's raining men
P
Weather girls

Humidity is rising (uh rising), barometer's getting low (how low girl?)
According to all sources (what sources now?), the street's the place to go (we better hurry up)
'Cause tonight for the first time (first time)
Just about half-past ten (half past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men (start raining men)

It's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men, amen
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet
It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, every specimen
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel, she rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
Oh, it's raining men, yeah

Barometer's getting low (it's getting low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low)
