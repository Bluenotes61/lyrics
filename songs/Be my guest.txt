Be my guest

Handsome can-man: pray sit down!
Unscrew your hat and unweld your gown.
It's so nice to have a guest.
I suggest you take a rest.
You may stay until you go away.
Yes, you may stay until the first of May.
Yes, you may stay even longer I dare say,
until the third of May!

'Least I hope that you might
stay for the night and get tight, mighty knight.
Yes let's put on our nighties,
and I'll show you what a real pillow fight is.
Let's make it snappy now,
and let's get happy now!
Because it's said:
there's no better place on earth than Sulitelmas bed.

But if you're falling short
it's an appalling sport
and I'll kick you out of my room,
because I hate the boys
who cannot mate the toys
My blood is hot!
