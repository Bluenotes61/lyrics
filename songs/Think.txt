Think
U
Aretha Franklin

Think, think, think, think
You think, think, think about it 

You better think!
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Yeah, Think let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back, let's go way on way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't â€˜ve been too much more than ten 
I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much high I.Q.
To see what you're doin' to me

You better think!
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Yeah, Think let your mind go, let yourself be free

Oh freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
Oh freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom

Hey - think about it
You! think about it

There ain't nothin' you could ask
I could answer you with I won't 
But I was gonna change my mind 
if you keep doin' things I don't 

Hey, think about what you're trying to do to me
Baby! Think, let your mind go, let yourself be free. 
People walkin' around everyday
Playin' games and takin' scores
Tryin' to make other people lose their minds
Well be careful you don't lose yours!

Yeah, think, think about what you trying to do to me
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, let your mind go, let yourself be free. 

You need me, and I need you
Without each other, ain't nothin' people can do
Yeah, think about it baby
