Long train running
P
Doobie brothers

Down around the corner a half a mile from here, 
you see them old trains runnin' 
and you watch them disappear. 

Without love, where would you be now, without love? 

You know I saw Miss Lucy down along the tracks; 
she lost her home and her family 
and she won’t be comin’ back. 

Without love, where would you be now, without love? 

Well, the Illinois Central 
and the Southern Central Freight, 
gotta keep on pushin’, Mama, 
‘cause you know they’re runnin’ late. 

Without love, where would you be now, without love?

‘cause you know they’re runnin’ late. 

Without love, where would you be now, without love? 

Where pistons keep on churnin’ 
and the wheels go ‘round and ‘round, 
and the steal rails are cold and hard 
for the miles that they go down. 

Without love, where would ya be right now, 
without love (rit), where would you be now? 

Vocal ad lib: 
Got to get it, baby, baby, won’t you move it down? 
Won’t you move it down? 
Baby, baby, baby, baby, won’t you move it down? 
When the big train run 
And the train is movin’ on 
I got to keep on movin’, 
Keep on movin’, 
Keep on movin’, 
Gonna keep on movin’.
