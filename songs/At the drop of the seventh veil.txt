At the drop of the seventh veil

Oh, how I love you, you stranger from afar!
Yes we know!
Nothing compares to a Swedish Blue Hussar!
Is that so?
Yeah!
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
yeyeyeyeyeah!

For I'm pretty sure of that
he hasn't got redundant fat
within his steel-suit,
for to me he's looking real' cute.
I wish that you were here, my dear,
and kicked the ass of our Grand Vizier.
I'll go bananas!
Give him to me now, Allah!

Oh, how I love you, you stranger from afar!
Nothing compares to a Swedish Blue Hussar!
Bang!
Come on, Allah!
Bang!
Come on, Allah!
Bang!
I go crazy!
Yes, I'm getting mad! I'm getting potty!

I stood in my hide-out and heard,
You overheard, you naughty boy!
a lovesong from you, little bird!
Because I love you man!
I'm caught by your beauty and by your grace.
I'm caught by yours.
I wonder if you let me suck your face?
I do, of course.
You are like champange in my blood!
You change me from gelding to stud,
you little rascal you!
The stars up above us
they say that we love us.
Yes, we love us, we love us both!

She is like champange in his blood.
He changes from gelding to stud.
The stars up above them
they say that they love them.
Each other, they're meaning by that.
