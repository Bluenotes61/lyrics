Bridge over troubled water

When you're weary, fealin' small
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
and friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay med down.

When you're down and out,
when you're on the street
when evening falls so hard, I will comfort you
I'll take your part, oh, when darkeness comes
and pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl, sail on by
though time has com to shine
all your dreams are on ther way
See how they shade, oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
