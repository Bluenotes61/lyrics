I’m yours
P

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you’re so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm tryin’ to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be givin it my best test
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more, 
it cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
Were just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So, I won't hesitate no more,
no more, it cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Du, du, du don’t you wanna you come over here
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

Du, du du

I've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
and so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'd be sayin' is there ain't no better reason
to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more 
it cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don’t, please don’t, please don’t, 
there’s no need to complicate,
‘Cause our time is short
This, this, this is our fate,
I’m yours 

So I won't hesitate no more,  no more 
it cannot wait, I'm yours
