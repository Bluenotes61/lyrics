Rockâ€™n roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock 'n' roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock 'n' roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my love on over 'cross the tracks
And she began her man a wailin' sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup
The folks are dancin', they got all shook up

And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock 'n' roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for the congo
So keep on rockin' that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
