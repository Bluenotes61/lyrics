Drive my car *
A

Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

Ella you can drive my car
Licenses won't get you far
Ella you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

I told that girl that my prospects were good
she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

Ella you can drive my car...
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah

Ella you can drive my car...

I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen babe I got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

Ella you can drive my car...
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
