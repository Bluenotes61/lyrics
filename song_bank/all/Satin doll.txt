Satin doll

Cigarette holder which wigs me
over my shoulder, he digs me
Out cattin' my satin doll

Baby, shall we go out steppin'
careful, amigo, you're flippin'
Speaks Latin, my satin doll

He's nobody's fool and I'm playing it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no boy catching me

Telephone number well you know, 
I'm doing my rumbas with uno
And that'n my satin doll
