The odalisque chorus line

Let's speed up our buttocks, girls!
Let's speed up our buttocks, girls!
Let's speed up our buttocks, girls!
Yes, the bodies shall work like a washing machine.

I bloody hate to be a bloody odalisque!
The eunuch makes me strut like a bloody wisk.
I know that I'm taking a bloody risk:
My spine has bloody lost every bloody disc!

Let's speed up our buttocks, girls!

I wish I'd obeyed my good old Ma
and married the horny and wealthy Shah.
Instead I am wriggling like the serpent Kaa,
each day destroying my Twilfit bra.

Let's speed up our buttocks, girls!

But I like our veils and our overalls,
and to see how my false breast jumps and falls.
When we danced with the eunuch in the Palace halls,
I liked his parties but preferred his balls.

Let's speed up our buttocks, girls!
