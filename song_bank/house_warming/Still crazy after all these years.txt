Still crazy after all these years

I met my old lover on the street last night 
He seemed so glad to see me I just smiled 
And we talked about some old times 
And we drank ourselves some beers 
Still crazy after all these years 
Oh, still crazy after all these years 

I'm not the kind of girl who tends to socialize 
I seem to lean on old familiar ways 
And I ain't no fool for love songs 
That whisper in my ears 
Still crazy after all these years 
Oh, still crazy after all these years 

Four in the morning crapped out, yawning 
Longing my life away 
I'll never worry, why should I? 
It's all gonna fade 

Now I sit by my window and I watch the cars 
I fear I'll do some damage one fine day 
But I would not be convicted by a jury of my peers 
Still crazy after all these years 
Oh, still crazy 
Still crazy 
Still crazy after all these years
