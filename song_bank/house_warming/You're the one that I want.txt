You're the one that I want

I got chills. They're multiplyin'.
And I'm losin' control.
'Cause the power you're supplyin',
it's electrifyin'!

You better shape up,
'cause I need a man
and my heart is set on you.
You better shape up;
you better understand
to my heart I must be true.

Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do.

You're the one that I want.
(you are the one i want), o,o, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
(you are the one i want want), o,o,oo, honey.
The one that I want
(you are the one i want want), o,o, ooooo
The one I need.
Oh, yes indeed.

If you're filled with affection
you're too shy to convey,
meditate in my direction.
Feel your way.

I better shape up,
'cause you need a man
- i need a man
who can keep me satisfied.
I better shape up
if I'm gonna prove
- you better prove
that my faith is justified.

Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside.

You're the one that I want.
(you are the one i want want), o, o, oo, honey.
The one that I want.
(you are the one i want want), o,o,oo, honey.
The one that I want
(you are the one i want),o, o, oo
The one I need.
Oh, yes indeed.
