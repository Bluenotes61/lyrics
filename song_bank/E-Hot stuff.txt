Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some Ella Ehlde this evenin'
I need some Ella Ehlde tonight
I want some Ella Ehlde this evenin'
Gotta have some Ella
Gotta have some Ella tonight
I need Ella
I want some Ella
I need some Ella

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Want to share my love with a warm blooded lover
Want to bring a wild man back home

Lookin' for some Ella Ehlde this evenin'...

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out, no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers lately
I'm bound to find somebody home

Lookin' for some Ella Ehlde this evenin'
