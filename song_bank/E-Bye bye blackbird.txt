Bye bye blackbird *
A

Pack up all my care and woe
here I go singin' low
Ella Ehlde

Where somebody waits for me
sugar's sweet , so is she
Ella Ehlde

No one here can love or understand me
oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me

Make my bed and light the light
I'll be home late tonight
Ella, bye bye
