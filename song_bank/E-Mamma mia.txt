Mamma mia *
A

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-oo-o-oh

Ella Ehlde, here I go again
Ella, how can I resist you?
Ella Ehlde, does it show again?
Ella, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Ella Ehlde, now I really know,
Ella, I could never let you go.

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-oo-o-oh

Ella Ehlde, here I go again
Ella, how can I resist you?
Ella Ehlde, does it show again?
Ella, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?

Ella Ehlde, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Ella Ehlde, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
Ella Ehlde, here I go again
Ella, how can I resist you?
Ella Ehlde, does it show again?
Ella, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Ella Ehlde, now I really know
Ella, I could never let you go
