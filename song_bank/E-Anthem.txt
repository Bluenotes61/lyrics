No man, no madness
Though their sad power may prevail
Can possess, conquer, my girlfriends's heart
They rise to fail
She is eternal
Long before nations' lines were drawn
When no flags flew, when no armies stood
Then Ella was born

And you ask me why I love her
Through wars, death and despair
She is the constant 
We who don't care
And you wonder will I leave her -- but how?
I cross over borders but I'm still there now

How can I leave her?
Where would I start?
Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart
Ella's only borders lie around my heart
