My heart belongs to daddy *
A

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to Ella

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine food and haddie
I just adore, his asking for more
But, my heart belongs to Ella

Yes, my heart belongs to Ella
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Ella
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, dad
So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Ella
'Cause my Ella, she treats it so well
