Ella don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let him into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Ella don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get him
The minute you let him under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain, Ella, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making this world a little colder
Da da da da da da da da da

Ella don't let me down
You have found him now go and get him
Remember to let him into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in
Ella begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Ella you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Na na Da da da da da da da da da Yeah

Ella don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let him under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better 
Better, better, better, better, better, Yeah,Yeah,Yeah
