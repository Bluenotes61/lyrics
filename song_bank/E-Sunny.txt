Ella, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Ella, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here
My Ella one shines so sincere
Ella one so true, I love you

Ella, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Ella, thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Ella one so true, I love you

Ella, thank you for the truth you let me see
Ella, thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like a windblown sand
And the rock was formed when you held my hand
Ella one so true, I love you

Ella, thank you for the smile upon your face
Ella, thank you for the gleam that shows its grace
You're my pawn of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Ella one so true, I love you
