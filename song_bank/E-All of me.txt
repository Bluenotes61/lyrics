All of me *
A

Ella E, 
why not take Ella E?
Can't you see, 
I'm no good without her
Take my lips, 
I wanna lose them
Take my arms, 
I'll never use them

Her goodbye 
left me with eyes that cry
How can I 
go on dear without her?
She took the part 
that once was my heart
So why not take Ella E?
