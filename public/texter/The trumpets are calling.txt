The trumpets are calling

Listen! The trumpeter's blast!
War is upon us at last!
Come on! And fast!
For now the Golden Horde is gonna dash the world to pieces.
Oh, I'm ready now to pull the trigger.
We are meaner than the Moslems figure
- set 'em on fire
till they expire.
Dancing on their graves I'm gonna' puff at a cigar-
rette. Vacuity is my donation,
robbery, felony and wild fornication!
Yes, I'm gonna' stamp right
out the Culture's lamp-light,
switch off to darkness!

Thousand kilo-kilo-kilo-kilowatts -
boom-boom
put out my dirty plots - boom-boom!
Samarkand I will sink into eternal night.
Let us blow out every light,
upon that I put a slight! 
What a fight!

Gee, what flash of victory will be.
I have a dream about a Mongolian night
over all of the world
where there is only one light
- that is me, I'm the lantern
My empire ranges from Rome to Shanghai.
And everyone gets fatter, 
- well at any rate will I!
