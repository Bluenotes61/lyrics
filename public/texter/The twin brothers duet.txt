The twin brothers' duet

I'm the one
your favourite son
second to none
anytime you want it done
I am so strong, I go to the gym;
pushing up and putting in
and working out and stretching down
- in every limb I outdo him.

I am your choice
the best of your boys
give me your voice
do not listen to his noice.
I've learned to read
and I've learned to write.
I am brainy, witty, clever,
smart and shrewed, intelligent:
so summing up: Let's call me bright!

Dearest father! -
Why can't you ever hold your mouth!
Dearest father! -
Why can't you ever hold your mouth!
Dearest father, you must without any doubt take me
me, no me, nomenomenomenomenome.
